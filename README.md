# TravelApp
 Travel Application for Project 1 of UCONN Bootcamp

 Team name - Let's Go!

 Team members -  Dave Leven, Liana Bette, Andrea Williams, Carlos Quinones

### Overall application’s concept: 
	Let's Go! helps travelers plan a trip by providing current weather and news as well as a map with useful data including local restaurants, bars, museums, and stores. 

### The motivation for its development:
	Destination traveling is a passion of our team and the motivation was to create a website that packages our travel interests into one website instead of searching multiple travel sites. User friendly interface on one page.

### Our design process:
  *	Our design process consisted of meeting as a group.
  *	Discussing our strengths and weaknesses.
  *	Breaking down into two groups for front and back end design.
  *	Discussing the technologies and libraries of interest to use. 
  *	Developing a sketch of the final product.

### The technologies used (and briefly how they work):	
  *	API - GooglePlaces and OpenWeather
  *	Framework - Bootstrap
  *	Programing languages - Javascript, JQuery 
  *	Database - Firebase

### Directions for future development:
  *	Improve database storage functionality.
  *	Implement Sidebar to illustrate search history and or favorite. 
  *	Add links to websites to points of interest, hotels and restaurant sites.
  *	Add flags/pins to map for points of interest, hotels and restaurant sites.

### Getting Started
	The site is deployed at https://junissen.github.io/TravelApp/#!
	There is a modal that pops up after the page loads to instruct you on how the site works. Once you enter the application it is set up to show Minneapolis and its points of interest as the viewing option. In the search bar you can enter a city that you would like to travel to. The autocomplete should help you with your choice. Once you click on that city, images of points of interest show up in a middle panel along with the current weather conditions. Below the middle panel there are 2 cards, one to the left that tells you more about the points of interest and the one to the right that contains a map with the location of that point of interest. As you move through the pictures, the place you are looking at is highlighted below in the left card and the map changes to show you the location of that place. Most recent searches saved in Firebase show up in the navagation bar. You can click on the Viewing Options on the navagation bar to show other items which include: Restaurants, Hotels and Points of Interest. The footer explains who was on the team that created the application as well as linking to their LinkedIn sites.

### Prerequisites

  *	Your design process
  *	The technologies you used (and briefly how they work)
  *	A demonstration of its functionality
  *	Directions for future development
  *	Treat the presentation seriously! 
  *	Talking intelligently about tech > doing tech sometimes.
