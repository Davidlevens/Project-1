### Application Concept: 
Let's Go! helps travelers plan a trip by providing current weather and news as well as a city map with useful data including local restaurants, bars, museums, and stores. 

### Development Motivation:
Destination traveling is a passion of our team and the motivation was to create a website that packages our travel interests into one website instead of searching multiple travel sites. The goal was to have a user friendly interface on one page load usefull aggregate travel information for planning a trip to a city destination anywhere in the world.

### Our Design Process:
  *	Our design process consisted of meeting as a group.
  *	Discussing our strengths and weaknesses.
  *	Breaking down into two groups for front and back end design.
  *	Discussing the technologies and libraries of interest to use. 
  *	Developing a sketch of the final product.
  
### Our Production Process:
  *	GitHub - Build Collaboration
  * Slack - Project Communications
  * Class Time - Team Synch Up & Reviews
  * QA - Unit Testing, Peer Reviews, Bug Tracking

### The technologies used:	
  *	API - GooglePlaces and OpenWeather
  *	Framework - Bootstrap
  *	Programing languages - Javascript, JQuery 
  *	Database - Firebase

### Future development considerations:
  *	Improve database storage functionality.
  *	Implement Sidebar to illustrate search history and or favorite. 
  *	Add links to websites to points of interest, hotels and restaurant sites.

### Getting Started
The site is deployed at https://davidlevens.github.io/Project-1/!
On page load, a splash page with a random background image and an input field for entering a destination city and below it button links to the top 10 destinations for the year according to "". Once a city is either entered and the "Let's go!" submit button is clicked or one of the pre-selected city buttons is clicked, an image of the inputed city loads with the city name and respective country code being displayed. Displayed below it are a two columned section that loads the current weather and a map of the inputed city with points of interest including local restaurants, bars, museums, and stores. Following below the two column section is a footer with contact information, links to social media and copyright information.
