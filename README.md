### Application Concept: 
Let's Go! helps travelers plan a trip by providing current weather and news as well as a city map with useful data including local restaurants, bars, museums, and stores. 

### Development Motivation:
Destination traveling is a passion of our team and the motivation was to create a website that packages our travel interests into one website instead of searching multiple travel sites. The goal was to have a user friendly interface on one page load usefull aggregate travel information for planning a trip to a city destination anywhere in the world.

### Our Design Process:
  *	Our design process consisted of meeting as a group.
  *	Discussing our strengths and weaknesses.
  *	Breaking down into two groups for front and back end design.
  *	Discussing the technologies and libraries of interest to use. 
  *	Developing a sketch of the final product.
  
### Our Production Process:
  *	GitHub - Build Collaboration
  * Slack - Project Communications
  * Class Time - Team Synch Up & Reviews
  * QA - Unit Testing, Peer Reviews, Bug Tracking

### The technologies used:	
  *	API - GooglePlaces and OpenWeather
  *	Framework - Bootstrap
  *	Programing languages - Javascript, JQuery 
  *	Database - Firebase

### Future development considerations:
  *	Improve database storage functionality.
  *	Implement Sidebar to illustrate search history and or favorite. 
  *	Add links to websites to points of interest, hotels and restaurant sites.

### Getting Started
The site is deployed at https://davidlevens.github.io/Project-1/!
On page load, a splash page with a random background image and an input field for entering a destination city. Once a city is entered and the "Let's go!" button is clicked, an image of the inputed city loads with the city name and respective country code being displayed. Displayed below it are a two columned section that loads the current weather and a current news section below it on left column and a map of the inputed city with points of interest including local restaurants, bars, museums, and stores on the right column. Following below the two column section is a footer with contact information, links to social media and copyright information.
